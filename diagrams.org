* Creating simple process diagrams in Emacs
  
  I needed this because I wanted to make a simple diagram. Usually, I
  would have drawn this in Signavio, or in PowerPoint, made a
  screenshot, saved it and embedded it in the Org-file using Emacs. 4
  steps, 4 softwares, and not much to show for it.

  Since I like to do everything in Emacs using the keyboard, I was
  curious if this can be done using ASCII, without extra tools. I
  found two ways (in fact, there is a third one, Emacs ~artist~ mode
  (built into Emacs) and ~ditaa~ (which is no longer distributed with
  Org).

  1) [[https://robrohan.com/2015/01/17/poor-mans-uml-artist-mode.html][Poor man's UML / Emacs Artist Mode]] (Rohan, 2015)
  2) [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-dot-diagrams.html][Generating simple process diagrams using dot and tables]]
  3) [[https://plantuml.com/emacs][PlantUML and Emacs]] - wrapper to [[http://www.graphviz.org/][GraphViz]]

     For today, I'll only try artist mode, but I'm especially
     interested in ~PlantUML~, because I want to teach the students to
     create simple UML diagrams before coding.

     *Note* that this really does not look great on GitHub (Org,
     Markdown) or HTML. Best look at it in Emacs. For this post, I
     have inserted screenshots.

* Emacs Artist mode

  #+begin_quote
  "Most people that see me using it either think it’s the most
  ridiculous thing they’ve seen, or they think it’s the coolest thing
  since sliced bread."
  #+end_quote

  I side with those who think it's cool. Tried this first a couple of
  years back when I returned to Emacs but haven't used it since.

  There is a video demo (13 min) at the end Rohan's blog post. Here,
  I'm going to retrace the demo and aim at creating my own simple
  diagram at the end.

  To make the ASCII art into image files, Rohan suggests [[http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/][~ditaa~]],
  which apparently was bundled with Org in the past, but is no longer
  bundled with it.

** Installation

   ~artist~ mode is built in.

   #+begin_quote
   "Artist is an Emacs lisp package that allows you to draw lines,
   rectangles, squares, poly-lines, ellipses and circles by using your
   mouse and/or keyboard. The shapes are made up with the ascii
   characters |, -, / and \."  ([[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ArtistMode][Source: EmacsWiki]])
   #+end_quote

*** Drawing a poly-line

    This is the example from the vignette:
    
	#+begin_example
    M-x artist-mode RET
    C-c C-a p RET
    RET
	#+end_example


──────f
      \─────────
                \─────────
                          \─────ooooo
                           ──/
                         ─/
                      ──/
                    ────────────
                                \──────────

                                

** ascii-art-to-unicode

   I found another neat addition in the package list,
   [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/ascii-art-to-unicode.html][~ascii-art-to-unicode~]], which polishes simple line drawings and
   makes them look much better. Installed it. Example use:

   | Key sequence        | Action or function           |
   |---------------------+------------------------------|
   | M-x artist-mode RET | Invoke artist mode           |
   | C-c C-a r           | ~artist-select-op-rectangle~ |

   [[./img/aa2u.png]]

   | Key sequence    | Action or function |
   |-----------------+--------------------|
   | C-c C-c         | ~artist-mode-off~  |
   | C-x n n         | ~narrow-to-region~ |
   | untabify region | ~untabify~         |
   | M-x aa2u RET    | Apply aa2u         |

   [[./img/aa2u1.png]]

   Check the [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/ascii-art-to-unicode.html][vignette for aa2u]] for more details.

* Org Tables

  This approach only requires vanilla Org-mode
